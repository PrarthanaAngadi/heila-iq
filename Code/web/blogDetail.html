                    The following is Part 2 of an in-depth interview (access Part 1 here) with Dipti Vaghela (left) co-founder  of Hydro Empowerment Network (HPNet). The organization, founded in 2012, brings practitioners a knowledge platform to advance micro-hydro power. HPNet focuses primarily on “policy, technology, and socio-environmental aspects for sustainability.” Vaghela, who serves as HPNet’s coordinator, talks to Microgrid News & Insight about her vision for HPNet and the future of micro-hydro power.

                        <h3>MGN: How did your interest in micro-hydro power come about and develop?</h3>
                        <p>
                            DV: My background in mechanical engineering and product design, along with my family’s roots in rural India, led me to spend a year volunteering India prior to grad school.  That year I fell in love with micro-hydro technology while taking part in an installation in a remote village of Ladakh, India.  Later, over a 7-year span of anchoring a statewide rural energy program, I had the rare opportunity to rehabilitate and iteratively advance a cluster of community-based micro hydro projects, where I witnessed the magical interconnection of vibrant watersheds, local ingenuity, and access to electricity.

                        <h3>MGN: HPNet’s work is primarily in south and southeast Asia. Are you optimistic about
                            developing
                            countries on other continents?</h3>
                        <p>
                            DV: Micro-hydro is relevant to any developing country with hilly with underground springs or river tributaries that provide perennial flow.  There is micro-hydro in North America, South America, Africa, and Australia.  HPNet currently focuses on building productive knowledge exchange relationships in south and southeast Asia, but since we are being contacted by practitioners in Africa for support, in the future we may help to support a practitioners platform there.

                        <h3>MGN: Which countries have had most success with micro-hydro? Why were those projects
                            particularly successful and how can that success be duplicated?</h3>

                        <p>
                            Nepal,  with its abundant natural resources, has been at the root of micro hydro in Asia. This couldn’t have happened without the World Bank and other international support to provide long-term capacity building and policy innovation that strengthens the local private sector.

                            micro-hydro-power-local-communityIndonesia has six ministries doing micro-hydro!  This is mostly thanks to [German international cooperation provider for sustainable development] GIZ’s work over the last three decades in building local capacities of the private sector and the government to do scaled micro-hydro programs.

                            The World Bank’s RERED program, excellently managed by the DFCC bank, has been the path-breaker to developing Sri Lanka’s scaled micro-hydro program. This program involves local entrepreneurs, local government, and VECS.  In recent years, the efficient institutional framework set up by the program has led to much-needed policy change and innovation, such as interconnected micro-hydro.

                            In all these countries, the governments have a great understanding of developing micro-hydro projects while at the same time nurturing the local private sector.  They also focus on encouraging local banks to provide financing.  In all these cases, practitioners are so advanced and sites have been mostly tapped such that their talent is now contributing to other regions, such as Myanmar, India, and Africa.
